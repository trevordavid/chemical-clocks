Abstract:
    Estimating stellar ages is important for advancing our understanding
    of stellar and exoplanet evolution and investigating the history of
    the Milky Way. However, ages for low-mass stars are hard to infer as
    they evolve slowly on the main sequence. In addition, empirical dating
    methods are difficult to calibrate for low-mass stars as they are
    faint. In this work, we calculate ages for Kepler F, G, and crucially
    K and M-dwarfs, using their rotation and kinematic properties. We
    apply the simple assumption that the velocity dispersion of stars
    increases over time and adopt an age-velocity-dispersion relation
    (AVR) to estimate average stellar ages for groupings of coeval stars.
    We calculate the vertical velocity dispersion of stars in bins of
    absolute magnitude, temperature, rotation period, and Rossby number
    and then convert velocity dispersion to kinematic age via an AVR.
    Using this method, we estimate gyro-kinematic ages for 29949 Kepler
    stars with measured rotation periods. We are able to estimate ages for
    clusters and asteroseismic stars with an rms of 1.22Gyr and 0.26Gyr
    respectively. With our Astraea machine-learning algorithm, which
    predicts rotation periods, we suggest a new selection criterion (a
    weight of 0.15) to increase the size of the McQuillan et al. catalog
    of Kepler rotation periods by up to 25%. Using predicted rotation
    periods, we estimated gyro-kinematic ages for stars without measured
    rotation periods and found promising results by comparing 12 detailed
    age-element abundance trends with literature values.

Description:
    To construct the gyro-kinematic age catalog, we started with the
    rotation period catalog from McQuillan+, 2014, J/ApJS/211/24 with
    34030 measured rotation periods and added an extra 4637 stars from
    Garcia+, 2014, J/A+A/572/A34 and Santos+, 2019, J/ApJS/244/21, which,
    combined, contain 38667 stars. We then accessed their Gaia data from
    the publicly available Kepler-Gaia DR2 cross-matched catalog produced
    with a 1" search radius.
    We cross-matched our rotation sample with the spectroscopic catalog
    produced by the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic
    Telescope (LAMOST) to obtain radial velocity (RVel) measurements.
    In addition to the primary photometric, spectroscopic, and kinematic
    data from Gaia, LAMOST, and Kepler, we also used multiple age catalogs
    in order to test our results. We used the isochrone age catalog from
    Berger+, 2020, J/AJ/160/108, the Kepler LEGACY asteroseismic age
    catalog from Silva Aguirre+, 2017, J/ApJ/835/173, the open cluster
    catalog from Curtis+, 2020ApJ...904..140C, and white dwarf cooling
    ages for two white dwarf M-dwarf binaries from R.Kiman+, (2021, in
    preparation).
